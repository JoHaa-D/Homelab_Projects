# Home Network Setup

## Overview
This project documents the planning, deployment, and configuration of a segmented home network using **Ubiquiti UniFi equipment**, with a focus on security, scalability, and network management.

The Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro (UDMP), was selected as the main network device with its feature-rich capabilities:
- Application-layer firewall
- VLAN segmentation
- DHCP & DNS management
- IDS/IPS functionality
- VPN and remote access support
- Network video recorder (NVR) capability
- 10 GB throughput
